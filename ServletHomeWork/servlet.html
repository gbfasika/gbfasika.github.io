<p>1, Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</p>
<p>An http post can be bookmarked but since a bookmark only consists of the URL all the form parameter will </p>
<p>be lost. This will often mean the web server does not know what to do with the request since it was</p>
<p>expecting some form parameter.</p>
<p>If we submit via get request, all the form parameter go into URL so bookmark will contain all the </p>
<p>information needed for the webserver to rebuild the page a second time.</p>
    
<p>2 What is the purpose of request dispatching?</p>
<p>Request dispatcher is an interface whose implementation define an object which can dispatches the request</p>
<p>to any resource on the server. 
    <p>The requestDispatcher interface provide the facility of dispatching the request to another resource 
        <p>it may
        <p>be html, servlet, or jsp. This interface can also be used to include the content of another resource also. 
            <p>It is one of the ways of servlet collaboration.
                <p>There are two methods defined in the requestDispatcher interface.
                    <p>a, forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) and 
                        <p>b, include(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response).
</p>
<p>3,What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
    <p>When a servlet does a redirect, it is like asking the client to call someone else instead. In this case,
        <p>the client is the browser not the user. The browser makes the new call on the user’s behalf after the
            <p>originally requested servlet say sorry call this guy instead. The user sees a new URL in the browser.
                <p>When a servlet does a request dispatch, it’s like asking a co-worker to take over working with a client.
                    <p>The co-worker ends up responding to the client, but the client doesn’t care as long as someone responds.
                        <p>The user never knows someone else took over, because the URL in the browser bar doesn’t change.
</p>
<p>4, what is an attribute?
    <p>An attribute is an object that is used to share information in web application. Attribute allows servlet 
        <p>to share information among themselves. Attribute can be Set and Get from one of the following.
            <p>A, request
                <p>B, Session
                    <p>C, Application.</p>
<p>5, What is the deference between attributes and parameters?</p>
The key difference between attributes and parameters is that an attribute is a variable of any type that 
is declared directly in a class while a parameter is a variable defined by the function that receive a
 value when it is called.
</p>
<p>6, What are dangers of using attributes?</P>
 <p>• Not thread safe </p>
<p>• Nor session attributes </p>
</p>• Only request attributes thread safe</p>

<p>7, What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</p>
<p>Because a stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about</p> 
<p>>each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests. HTTP is a stateless protocol which</p>
<p>means that the connection between the browser and server is lost once the transaction is ends.</p>

<p>8, Give 5 different method for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).</p>
<p>• request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing request </p>
<p>• session scope: destroyed when user closes browser</p>
<p>• application scope destroyed when Container stopped. </p>
<p>• Cookies saved on browser, temporary (deleted when the browser closes) permanent</p>
<p>• Hidden fields on a form</p>
<p>9, How long does a Session last?</p>
<p>The default values are 1 and 100 so the garbage collector is only started in only 1% of all Session start</p> 
<p>calls. That means even if the session is already timed out in theory (the session data had been changed </p>
<p>more than session.gc maxlifetime second a go), the session data can be used longer than that. Recommend </p>
<p>us to implement our own session timeout mechanism. </p>
</p>
<p>

<p>10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</p>
<p>There are two types of cookies in servlet. Persistent and Non-Persistent cookies</p> 
<p>Non-Persistent is valid for single session only. It is removed each time when user closes the browser.</p>
 <p>Persistent cookies are valid for multiple session. It is not removed each time when user closes the </p>
 <p>browser. It removed only if user logout or sign out.</p>
</p>
<p>

 <p>11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</p>
<p>It will always work whether cookies are disabled or not (browser independent). </p>
<p>Extra form submission is not required on each page.</p>

<p>12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</p>
 <p>A reasonably likely explanation is that the requests are not in the same session.</p>
  <p>Maintaining a session requires cooperation from the client, which is not guaranteed to be given. </p>
  <p>The most common mechanisms for associating requests with sessions are cookies and URL rewriting. </p>
  <p>If the client refuses cookies and is making its requests to a static URL then every request will </p>
  <p>likely be in its own session.</p>
