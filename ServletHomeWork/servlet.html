        1, Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?
An http post can be bookmarked but since a bookmark only consists of the URL all the form parameter will 
be lost. This will often mean the web server does not know what to do with the request since it was
 expecting some form parameter.
If we submit via get request, all the form parameter go into URL so bookmark will contain all the 
information needed for the webserver to rebuild the page a second time.
2 What is the purpose of request dispatching?
Request dispatcher is an interface whose implementation define an object which can dispatches the request
 to any resource on the server. 
The requestDispatcher interface provide the facility of dispatching the request to another resource it may
 be html, servlet, or jsp. This interface can also be used to include the content of another resource also. It is one of the ways of servlet collaboration.
There are two methods defined in the requestDispatcher interface.
a, forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) and 
b, include(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response).
3,What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
When a servlet does a redirect, it is like asking the client to call someone else instead. In this case,
 the client is the browser not the user. The browser makes the new call on the user’s behalf after the
  originally requested servlet say sorry call this guy instead. The user sees a new URL in the browser.
When a servlet does a request dispatch, it’s like asking a co-worker to take over working with a client.
The co-worker ends up responding to the client, but the client doesn’t care as long as someone responds.
The user never knows someone else took over, because the URL in the browser bar doesn’t change.
4, what is an attribute?
An attribute is an object that is used to share information in web application. Attribute allows servlet 
to share information among themselves. Attribute can be Set and Get from one of the following.
A, request
B, Session
C, Application.
5, What is the deference between attributes and parameters?
The key difference between attributes and parameters is that an attribute is a variable of any type that 
is declared directly in a class while a parameter is a variable defined by the function that receive a
 value when it is called.

6, What are dangers of using attributes?
 • Not thread safe 
• Nor session attributes 
• Only request attributes thread safe
7, What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.
Because a stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about 
each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests. HTTP is a stateless protocol which
 means that the connection between the browser and server is lost once the transaction is ends.
8, Give 5 different method for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).
• request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing request 
• session scope: destroyed when user closes browser
 • application scope destroyed when Container stopped. 
• Cookies saved on browser, temporary (deleted when the browser closes) permanent
 • Hidden fields on a form
9, How long does a Session last?
The default values are 1 and 100 so the garbage collector is only started in only 1% of all Session start 
calls. That means even if the session is already timed out in theory (the session data had been changed 
more than session.gc maxlifetime second a go), the session data can be used longer than that. Recommend 
us to implement our own session timeout mechanism. 

10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?
There are two types of cookies in servlet. Persistent and Non-Persistent cookies 
Non-Persistent is valid for single session only. It is removed each time when user closes the browser.
 Persistent cookies are valid for multiple session. It is not removed each time when user closes the 
 browser. It removed only if user logout or sign out.


 11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?
It will always work whether cookies are disabled or not (browser independent). 
Extra form submission is not required on each page.
 12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?
 A reasonably likely explanation is that the requests are not in the same session.
  Maintaining a session requires cooperation from the client, which is not guaranteed to be given. 
  The most common mechanisms for associating requests with sessions are cookies and URL rewriting. 
  If the client refuses cookies and is making its requests to a static URL then every request will 
  likely be in its own session.
